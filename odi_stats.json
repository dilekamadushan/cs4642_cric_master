He had been a fixture in the Sri Lanka team, and well\nrespected throughout cricketing circles around the world, having played minor county cricket for Linconshire and Shropshire. With his flighted legbreaks and well disguised wrong 'uns, de Silva was a consistent wicket-taker throughout the 70s. In Sri Lanka's inaugural Test he captured 3 for 54 and 0 for 38, his first Test wicket being that of David Gower caught at the wicket by Mahes Goonatilleke. de Silva distinguished himself on the following tour to Pakistan, taking seventeen wickets in three Tests, including the first five-wicket haul by a Sri Lankan when he took 5 for 59 at Faisalabad. When Duleep Mendis was injured early on the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand, de Silva was handed the honour of\nleading Sri Lanka in two Tests. With the bat, he was more than useful making two half centuries, both as captain. He maintained his prominence within the game, later coaching Sri Lanka. He was later appointed cricket advisor by the Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa in December 2007 to promote the game in the country's war-hit northern areas. In 2009 De Silva was appointed chairman of a seven-member interim committee to run Sri Lanka Cricket by sports minister Gamini Lokuge.\n", " (March 2009) \n"], "odi_highest_score": "37*", "odi_batting_innings": "29", "odi_bowling_SR": "64.8", "odi_batting_NO": "10", "odi_50": "0", "odi_bowling_innings": "40", "odi_bowling_5W": "0", "name": "Somachandra De Silva", "odi_bowling_econ": "4.50", "country": ["Sri Lanka"], "odi_bowling_matches": "41", "odi_batting_matches": "41", "odi_bowling_average": "48.65", "odi_BBM": "3/29", "odi_BBI": "3/29", "odi_bowling_balls": "2076", "odi_100": "0"},

But after just one week he packed his bags to concentrate on cricket. That gamble finally paid off when he scored an unbeaten 74 in only his third ODI, against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo. Since then he has been essentially a back-up batsman, playing the last of his 17 ODIs against Australia in early 2004. The closest he came to selection again was when he was named in the probables for Sri Lanka's ICC Champions Trophy campaign in 2006. At age 34, with his international career behind him, Jayantha signed on with the unofficial Indian Cricket League.

From a bustling run-up and whippy open-chested action, he generates a lively pace, moves the ball off the seam and can reverse-swing the ball. Most importantly though, he can maintain a tight line and length. He started his career as a softball enthusiast before he shifted his focus to cricket, joining Nugegoda Cricket Club and then Galle Cricket Club.

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately. \n", "Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.", "Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.", "In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews.

Despite making 51 not out in his last ODI against Zimbabwe, Arnold was dropped from the ODI and Test teams in July 2004. The seven-man Ashantha de Mel selection committee wanted to blood new talent and Arnold's future looked bleak for a while. But he worked hard on his game in the nets and started to score heavily in domestic cricket. Finally, with his replacements failing to impress, he won a recall for the New Zealand tour in December 2004.

His explosive qualities in the middle order made him an asset in the limited-overs game. But his bowling has also continued to improve, making him a better bet for Tests as well. Murali's withdrawal from the tour to Australia in 2004 put additional responsibility on him, and he responded well. As the year progressed, his legbreaks, traditionally nagging rather than explosive, started to fizz more venomously. More importantly, his line and length tightened up.

He swings and seams the ball with skill, his trademark delivery being the late indipper. However, he also bowls a carefully disguised offcutter, and has recently added reverse-swing to his armoury, a skill that has made him a consistent wicket-taker even on bland subcontinental pitches. He outbowled New Zealand's seamers in green conditions at Napier to give Sri Lanka their first win in an overseas Test, in 1994-95. In 2001-02 he made a quantum leap, taking 26 wickets in the 3-0 rout of West Indies, becoming only the second fast bowler, after Imran Khan, to take 14 wickets in a match in the subcontinent. He then went on to take the first-ever ODI eight-for, against Zimbabwe, which included a hat-trick. He also claimed a hat-trick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup.

What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18.

From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. ", "The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.", "Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa.

Whenever called upon he was a wholehearted performer, though at Test level his bowling lacked penetration, highlighted by the fact he never took a five wicket haul in 18 Tests. Capable of extended spells of sustained accurate bowling, willing to flight and turn the ball, Anurasiri was often used to contain the batsman on unresponsive wickets.

To compliment his ability with the ball he was also a competent left-hand batsman in the lower order.

Perhaps his greatest attribute was his tenacity and resolve, always willing to compete in a side that was usually less than competitive.

On the unresponsive wickets in Pakistan he toiled in relative obscurity earning four expensive wickets and batting as low as No. 10.

Pushed into the opening position on the tour of India in 1985-86, Ratnayeke responded to the added responsibility. In his debut innings combating the new ball he scored a remarkable 93 adding 159 with Siddath Wettimuny, later capturing 4 wickets in a superb allround display. In the second Test, as Sri Lanka capitulated he\nheld firm top scoring with 54, upstaging his more distinguished colleagues.
