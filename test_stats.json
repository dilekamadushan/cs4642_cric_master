That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least.  \n", "Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015.

From the age of 11, when he first turned out for Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Kapugedera had hardly wasted an opportunity to push himself up the ladder. He had captained all the junior school sides from the U-13 to the first XI. Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. ", "It was an innings he had rated as one of his best although he batted equally well for 70 in his first game for Sri Lanka A against the strong New Zealand A team in 2005. The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches.", "Kapugedera's father, also a former Dharmaraja cricketer, provided early coaching and all the encouragement he needed to develop. David Karunaratne (his first coach) and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya (his U-19 coach) also played important roles in shaping Kapugedera's career. He was first picked in the national squad against India in November but pulled out of the tour with an injury.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. \n", "Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ", "Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.", "But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014.", "It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan's farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his \"chronic knee injury\" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL's iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.", "Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. ", "He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years.

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately. \n", "Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.", "Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.", "In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews.

Despite making 51 not out in his last ODI against Zimbabwe, Arnold was dropped from the ODI and Test teams in July 2004. The seven-man Ashantha de Mel selection committee wanted to blood new talent and Arnold's future looked bleak for a while. But he worked hard on his game in the nets and started to score heavily in domestic cricket. Finally, with his replacements failing to impress, he won a recall for the New Zealand tour in December 2004.

For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed. \n", "Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. ", "The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.", "Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. ", "Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series. As the years passed, his shyness gave way to a quiet confidence and wry sense of humour, and he won admirers around the world for the energy, time and money that he invested in reconstruction after a tsunami had devastated the Sri Lankan coast in 2004. Often the only Tamil in the side in a time of ethnic conflict, he became as powerful a unifying force as any in the country.

On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. All his big Test innings - he scored six double-hundreds in his career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond and Brian Lara (seven each) - were been slow affairs but the most tortuous episode of his international career was its start: it took him nearly seven years to get established. However, since the 1990s his average climbed upwards. An elegant player to watch, Atapattu's signature shot was his high-elbow cover-drive. \n", "For three years he stood as Jayasuriya's understudy before being appointed to lead the one-day side in April 2003. He had been expected to take charge of the Test team as well, but the selection committee appointed Hashan Tillakaratne for that job. Atapattu's career took another bizarre twist later in the year when embroiled in the cash-in-the-bedroom affair in which a match-fixing investigation was initiated after a large sum of cash was discovered in the safe of the hotel room he had occupied during England's tour in 2003. The ICC later cleared Atapattu of any wrongdoing and the likeliest explanation for the mystery remains a crude attempt to blacken his reputation.", "But by early 2004 the team was drifting downwards under Tillakaratne and the selectors were finally compelled to appoint Atapattu as the Test captain. Within weeks he had halted the team's slide and established himself as a strong leader. On the surface a quiet and reserved character, his captaincy pedigree was not entirely obvious to the outsider, but within the dressing-room he was a straight-talking and positive captain, firm and fair in his dealings with the players and aggressive in his approach to the game. By mid-2004 the fortunes of the team had changed as Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and whitewashed South Africa. The team fared poorly in the ICC Champions Trophy but perked up against Pakistan in October 2004.", "But Atapattu's capacity for attracting the unexpected continued when, out of the blue, Ashantha de Mel, the new government-appointed chairman of selectors, launched a scathing attack on the team management on the eve of the Paktel Cup in 2004-05, accusing them of blocking his attempts to blood new players. Atapattu wisely steered clear of a public confrontation, though his relationship with the selectors remained prickly. ", "His career was put on hold by a back injury early in 2006 which led to Mahela Jayawardene taking on the captaincy. He was slowly reintroduced to the one-day side, but his tussles with the selectors continued. He was a late inclusion on the Australian tour following a ministerial intervention to bring him into the squad, but midway through the series he hit out at the selectors again, calling them \"a set of muppets headed by a joker\". He scored two half-centuries in the series, including 80 in the second innings in Hobart, but announced his retirement from international cricket on the last day of the Test.   ", "Atapattu then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Delhi Giants and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Atapattu was free to play domestic cricket back home.", "Since retirement from all cricket, Atapattu has forged a reputation as a technically adroit and hard-working batting coach, particularly for his work with the Sri Lanka team. He has been the national side's batting coach since 2011, and was promoted to the position of assistant coach in March 2013.
